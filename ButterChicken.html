   <h3>Description:</h3>
   <p>This is a recipe for butter chicken, a curry of chicken in a spiced tomato, butter, and cream sauce. Its similar to chicken tikka masala.
     This recipe was developed as a means to satiate my never ending cravings for saucy chicken dishes that can be eaten with rice. Its full of flavor, and is fairly easy to make. Many of the ingredients can be omitted if you lack them, and theres plenty of 
        variations on how this dish can be prepared.</p> 
   <h3>ingredients:</h3>
   <h5>Chicken</h5>
   <ul>
       <li>1 cup full fat greek yogurt</li>
       <li>1 Tbsp garam masala</li>

       <li>1 1/2 lbs boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
   </ul>

       <li>6 cloves of sliced garlic</li>
       <li>2 tsp paprika</li>
       <li>2 tsp ground cumin</li>

   <h3>Instructions:</h3>
   <ol>
       <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together yogurt, garam masala, and salt.</li>
       <li>Toss with sliced chicken thighs until fully coated. Cover and marinate for 30 minutes or overnight.</li>
       <li>In a large pot or dutch oven, heat vegetable oil over medium-high heat until shimmering hot.</li>
       <li>Add chicken in batches and sear 2-3 minutes on each side. Set to side once done.</li>
       <li>Lower the same pan to medium heat, add a touch of more oil along with diced onions, diced ginger, sliced garlic, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Mix and stir, sauteing for 2-3 minutes or until softened.</li>
       <li>Add in spices and stir together until spices have toasted for 1-2 minutes. </li>
       <li>After toasting, add in crushed tomatoes and water then stir until incorporated over medium heat. Let simmer for 5-8 minutes until the sauce has reduced. </li>
       <li>Once reduced, with an immersion blender, blend the tomato and water mixture until smooth.</li>
       <li>Add chicken back to the pan mixing into the sauce and let simmer for 3-5 minutes.</li>
       <li>Add in heavy cream stirring until thickened and incorporated. Bring up to a light simmer before reducing heat to low and simmering for no longer than 3-4 minutes. Stir often. </li>
       <li>Turn off the heat and continuously stir in unsalted butter until melted. Season to taste with salt. </li>
