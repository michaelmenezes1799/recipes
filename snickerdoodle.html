   <h3>Description:</h3>
   <p>If you think snickerdoodles are simply cinnamon sugar cookies, think again. Properly made, they have crispier edges and chewier middles, with a rich and tender crumb beneath their shimmery crusts. Once upon a time, those qualities came from cutting butter with hydrogenated shortening, but virgin coconut oil does a better job. Its subtle aroma heightens both the cinnamon and the vanilla, while helping the snickerdoodles stay rich, moist, and chewy.</p>
   <h3>ingredients:</h3>
   </ul> 
        <li>4 ounces unsalted butter (1 stick; 114g), firm but pliable, about 60°F</li>  
        <li>3 ounces virgin coconut oil (heaping 1/3 cup; 85g)</li>   
        <li>10 1/2 ounces sugar (about 1 1/2 cups; 298g)</li>
        <li>1 1/4 teaspoon (6g) kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon (4g) baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 ounce vanilla extract (about 1 tablespoon; 15g)</li>
        <li>1 large egg, straight from the fridge (about 1 3/4 ounces; 50g)</li>
        <li>10 1/2 ounces all purpose flour (about 2 1/3 cups, spooned; 295g)</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>For the Cinnamon Sugar:</h3>
   <ul>
       <li>2 ounces sugar (1/4 cup; 57g)</li>
       <li>4 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
       <li>Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 400°F (200°C). Combine butter, coconut oil, sugar, salt, baking powder, and vanilla in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix at low speed to combine, then increase to medium and beat until soft, fluffy, and pale, about 5 minutes, although the exact timing will vary. Halfway through, pausing to scrape the bowl and beater with a flexible spatula, and then resume mixing on medium speed. Add the egg and continue beating until smooth. Reduce speed to low, add flour, and mix to form a stiff dough.</li>
       <br>
       <li>Using a cookie scoop, divide dough into 2-tablespoon portions. If you like, these can be transferred to a zipper-lock bag and refrigerated for up to 1 week, or frozen for up to 3 months; soften to about 68°F (20°C) before baking.</li>
       <br>
       <li>For the Cinnamon Sugar: Mix sugar with ground and grated cinnamon in a small bowl, adding more spice if you prefer. (It should taste very intense to offset the mild dough.) Roll each portion of dough into a smooth and sticky ball, then tumble in cinnamon sugar until fully coated.</li>
       <br>
       <li>Arrange on a parchment-lined aluminum half sheet pan, leaving 2 1/2 inches between balls, then flatten into 2-inch disks about 1/2 inch thick. Generously cover with the remaining cinnamon sugar, creating a thick layer that will crack and crinkle in the oven.</li>
       <br>
       <li>Bake until the snickerdoodles begin to spread, about 5 minutes, then reduce temperature to 350°F (175°C). Continue baking until firm around the edges but steamy in the middle, about 6 minutes longer. Cool directly on half sheet pan until the crumb is set, about 8 minutes. Enjoy warm, or store in an airtight container for up to 3 days at room temperature.</li>
